In the beginning, Jason Kottke [created stellar.io](http://kottke.org/11/03/introducing-stellar) and we gazed upon it, and it was good.

But then the site started going down, the database ran out of memory, and it was [finally sunsetted](http://stellar-status.tumblr.com/post/147805983872/our-incredible-journey).

Interstellar is an attempt to replicate part of the functionality of stellar, in a way we can run just for ourselves, and on the cheap.  Stellar is dead... long live Stellar?
